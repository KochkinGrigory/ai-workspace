# Визуальный стиль

## Общая эстетика

**Design Style:** Minimalist Modern
**Mood:** Clean, Professional, Trustworthy, Approachable
**Inspiration:** Swiss Design, Flat Design 2.0, Material Design principles
**Era:** Contemporary (2020s)

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Simplicity
- Minimum elements on screen
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Generous white space (never cramped)
- Focus on content, not decoration
- "Less is more" philosophy

### 2. Geometry & Structure
- Clean geometric shapes (rectangles, circles, minimal curves)
- Rounded corners: 8-12px for cards, 4-6px for buttons
- 8px grid system for alignment
- Rule of thirds for composition
- Consistent spacing multiples (8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64px)

### 3. Color Usage
- Color carries meaning (not decorative)
- Limited palette (3-4 colors maximum per design)
- High contrast for accessibility (WCAG AA minimum)
- Neutral backgrounds (white, light gray)
- Accent colors used sparingly for emphasis

### 4. Typography
- Strong typographic hierarchy
- Sans-serif for modern feel
- Sufficient size for readability (min 16px body)
- Ample line spacing (1.5-1.6 for body)
- Left-aligned text for easy scanning

## Layout & Composition

### Grid System
- 12-column grid for web layouts
- 8px baseline grid for vertical rhythm
- Consistent margins and gutters
- Symmetry or intentional asymmetry (never random)

### Spacing Philosophy
- Base unit: 8px
- Standard spacing: 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px
- Never use odd numbers (keeps alignment clean)
- Consistent rhythm and pattern

### Visual Hierarchy
- Size: Larger = more important
- Weight: Bolder = more important
- Color: Accent color = focus point
- Position: Top-left gets most attention (F-pattern)
- Contrast: High contrast = draws attention

### Depth & Elevation
- Minimal shadows (subtle only)
- Shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1) for cards
- Shadow: 0 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.15) for modals
- Maximum 3 elevation levels
- Avoid heavy drop shadows

## Design Elements

### Icons
- Style: Line art, minimalist, geometric
- Stroke width: 2px consistent
- Size: Multiples of 24px (24, 48, 72, 96)
- Style consistency crucial (all from same set)
- Match brand personality (friendly but professional)

### Photography
- Style: Natural, professional, authentic
- Lighting: Soft natural light or professional studio
- Composition: Rule of thirds, balanced
- Colors: Natural tones, minimal editing
- Avoid: Stock photo "generic" look, overly posed

### Illustrations
- Style: Flat design or isometric
- Colors: From brand palette only
- Complexity: Medium (not overly simple, not too detailed)
- Consistency: Same style throughout project
- Purpose: Support message, not decoration

### Shapes & Forms
- Primary shapes: Rectangles, circles
- Rounded corners preferred over sharp
- Avoid: Irregular shapes, complex curves
- Alignment: Always aligned to grid

## What to Avoid

❌ Gradients (except subtle backgrounds: light to slightly lighter)
❌ Textures and patterns (unless brand-specific and subtle)
❌ Heavy shadows and 3D effects
❌ Too many colors (more than 4)
❌ Decorative elements without function
❌ Cluttered layouts with no white space
❌ Low contrast text (below WCAG AA)
❌ Inconsistent styling
❌ Trendy effects that date quickly
